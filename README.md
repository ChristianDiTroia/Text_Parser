# Text Parser
Text Parser is a cross-platform python GUI app built to parse out lines and sentences from various file types. Additionally, parsed text can be randomized using a signed integer seed. It is intended to be used as a creative writing tool, inspired by writing in which fragments of text are taken from a source material and incorporated into a new piece.

## Usage
- upload any .txt, .docx, or .pdf file containing text to parse its sentences and lines
- parsed tokens can be randomized with a provided or random seed
- get any given number of parsed tokens from the uploaded file in the left text box, then edit and save the result in the right text box
